 /*A bank in your town updates its customers’ accounts at the end of each month. 
 The bank offers two types of accounts: savings and checking.
 Every customer must maintain a minimum balance. If a customer’s balance falls below the
 minimum balance, there is a service charge of $10.00 for savings accounts and $25.00 for
 checking accounts. If the balance at the end of the month is at least the minimum balance, 
 the account receives interest as follows:
 
 * Savings accounts receive 4% interest.
 * Checking accounts with balances of up to $5,000 more than the
   minimum balance receive 3% interest; otherwise, the interest is 5%.
 
 Write a program that reads a customer’s account number (int type), account type 
 (char) s for savings, c for checking, minimum balance that the account should maintain, 
 and current balance. The program should then output the account number, account type,
 current balance, and an appropriate message. 
 
 Test your program by running it five times,using the following data:
 
 46728 S 1000 2700
 87324 C 1500 7689
 79873 S 1000 800
 89832 C 2000 3000
 98322 C 1000 750
